<p>What is distinctive about the way Rafael Nadal plays tennis? Is Novak Djokovic's playing style more like Roger Federer's or Andy Murray's? These questions all center on the idea of "playing style". While tennis fans and commentators have a general intuition of different playing styles even among the best players in the world, there aren't good ways to quantify these styles. The aim of this project is to begin to understand playing styles by examining player similarity in shot taking.</p>

<a id="project-goals" class="anchor" href="#project-goals" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Goals</h3>

<p>The student will use shot trajectory data gathered by Hawk-Eye systems at the 2012 to 2014 Australian Open to describe shot-taking characteristics. Different measures of similarity will be investigated and applied to the shot features among the top 10 ranked male singles tennis players during this period. The student will submit a report, written in R markdown, describing the pros and cons of the similarity measures and the findings from their application to the tennis dataset.</p>
